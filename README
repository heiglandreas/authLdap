Use your existing LDAP as authentication-backend for your wordpress!

So what are the differences to other Wordpress-LDAP-Authentication-Plugins?

* Flexible: You are totaly free in which LDAP-backend to use. Due to the extensive configuration you can
freely decide how to do the authentication of your users. It simply depends on your
filters
* Independent: As soon as a user logs in, it is added/updated to the Wordpress' user-database
to allow wordpress to always use the correct data. You only have to administer your users once.
* Failsafe: Due to the users being created in Wordpress' User-database they can
also log in when the LDAP-backend currently is gone.
* Role-Aware: You can map Wordpress' roles to values of an existing LDAP-attribute.
